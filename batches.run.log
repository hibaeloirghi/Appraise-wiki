(6, 'This is what happened to a woman from the German-Dutch border area: She sued the state social court of North Rhine-Westphalia because the German pension insurance did not want to take into account the time she spent raising children in the Netherlands. The plaintiff lived in the Netherlands near Aachen for many years. She completed her training as a cross-border commuter in Aachen, but was never subject to social security contributions. She had two children who she raised in the Netherlands and did not work during this time. It was only many years later that she moved to Germany and then paid into the pension fund for the first time.')

(9, 'The ECJ has already developed this criterion in previous decisions. It has therefore been clear for some time that, in principle, periods spent raising children in other EU countries must also be taken into account when calculating pensions. What is new, however, is that there is a “sufficient connection” even if the person concerned did not pay any contributions to the pension insurance before raising children abroad.')
