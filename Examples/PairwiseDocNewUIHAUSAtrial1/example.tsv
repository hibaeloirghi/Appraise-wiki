1	So erging es auch einer Frau aus dem deutsch-niederländischen Grenzgebiet: Sie hat vor dem Landessozialgericht Nordrhein-Westfalen geklagt, weil die Deutsche Rentenversicherung ihre Kindererziehungszeit in den Niederlanden nicht anrechnen wollte. Die Klägerin wohnte viele Jahre in den Niederlanden in der Nähe von Aachen. Ihre Ausbildung hatte sie als Grenzgängerin in Aachen absolviert, war aber nie sozialversicherungspflichtig tätig. Sie bekam zwei Kinder, die sie in den Niederlanden aufgezogen hatte und war währenddessen nicht berufstätig. Erst viele Jahre später zog sie nach Deutschland und zahlte dann erstmals in die Rentenkasse ein.	This is a fake reference.	This is what happened to a woman from the German-Dutch border area: She filed a lawsuit before the Regional Social Court of North Rhine-Westphalia because the German pension insurance did not want to take into account her child-rearing time in the Netherlands. The plaintiff lived for many years in the Netherlands, near Aachen. She had completed her training as a cross-border commuter in Aachen, but was never subject to social security contributions. She had two children whom she had raised in the Netherlands and was not working during this time. It was not until many years later that she moved to Germany and paid into the pension fund for the first time.

1	Dieses Kriterium hat der EuGH bereits in früheren Entscheidungen entwickelt. Deswegen war schon länger klar, dass grundsätzlich auch Kindererziehungszeiten im EU-Ausland bei der Rentenberechnung berücksichtigt werden müssen. Neu ist aber, dass eine "hinreichende Verbindung" selbst dann besteht, wenn die Betroffene vor der Kindererziehungszeit im Ausland keine Beiträge in die Rentenversicherung eingezahlt hat.	This is a fake reference.	This criterion has already been developed by the ECJ in previous decisions. For this reason, it has been clear for some time that child-rearing periods in other EU countries must also be taken into account when calculating pensions. What is new, however, is that there is a "sufficient connection" even if the person concerned did not pay any contributions to the pension insurance scheme before the child-rearing period abroad.
